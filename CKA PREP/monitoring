what we monitor
a. Node metrics like number of nodes, health
b. performance metrics: cpu, memory, network and disk utilization
c. pod level metrics: number of pods, performance of each pods.

K8 has no inbuilt monitoring tool. There are 3rd party monitoring tools like Prometheus, Metric sERVER, elastic stack, data dog, dynatrace

=====deploy metrics-server to monitor the PODs and Nodes.======

Pull the git repository for the deployment files.
>>git clone https://github.com/kodekloudhub/kubernetes-metrics-server.git

Deploy the metrics-server by creating all the components downloaded.
>>k create -f .

===to vieew performance metrics=====
k top node
k top pods


logs in kubernetes
built like a pod ---using a manifest file e.g event-simulator.yaml

ApiVersion: v1
Kind: pod
Metadata:
   Name: event-simulator-pod

Spec:
   Containers:
   - Name: event-simulator
   - Image: KodeKloud/event-simulator
   
>>k create -f envent-simulator.yaml

===to run logs ====

>>> k logs -f event-simulator-pod
