what we monitor
a. Node metrics like number of nodes, health
b. performance metrics: cpu, memory, network and disk utilization
c. pod level metrics: number of pods, performance of each pods.

K8 has no inbuilt monitoring tool. There are 3rd party monitoring tools like Prometheus, Metric sERVER, elastic stack, data dog, dynatrace
