taint is placed on a node to only allow pods with its toleration to be placed on it
toleration is placed on pods to specify/allow pods to be placed on a tainted node.

>>>k taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect

taint-effect specifies what happens to the nodes if it does not tolerate the taint. There are 3 effects. 1 is Noschedule 2. is PreferNoSchedule and 3 is NoExecute

e.g >>> taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule

Tolerations: is added to pods. to add toleration pull up the pod definition file

====pod defintion yaml====
ApiVersion: v1
Kind: pod
Metadata:
   Name: mypod
Spec:
   Containers:
     - Name: Nginx
       image: Nginx:Latest
   Tolerations:
     - key: "app"
       Operator: "Equal"
       Value: "blue"
       Effect: "NoSchedule"
       
taint and toleration does not tell a pod to go to a particular node. It only tells a node what pod can be placed on it. 
to determine that a pod will go to a particular node, we use node affinity.

====to remove a taint on command line =====

>>k taint nodes [node_name] [taint_name]-
