to create a node selector, we need to label the node first
=====to label a node use the following cmd ========
>>>k label nodes [node_name] [label-key]=[label-value]
e'g k label nodes node01 size=large

for a complex node requirement e.g to place on any node that is large, medium but not small, node selector is inadequate to meet this hence the need for node affinity
