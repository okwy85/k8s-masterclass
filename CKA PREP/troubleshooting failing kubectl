say the kubectl isnt responding
it means the kubectl utility isnt cpommunicating with the kube-apiserver
we need to look at the status  of the kubeapi-server since it is a pod running as container on a host
docker ps -a | grep kube-apiserver >>it will show the container id
docker logs container_id >>logs show error while dialling TCP 127.0.0.1:2379 which is the IP for etcd-server-port
docker ps -a | grep etcd >> it will show info about etcd, we can take  the container id
docker logs container_id  >> logs shows that /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server-certificate.crt doesnt exit
we verify by going to the directory ls /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ . if server-certificate.crt doesnt exit then we edit the manifest.
vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml


to view a certificate

openssl x509 -in file-path.crt -text -noout
openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout
